<h2> What's inside </h2>
<p> A quick way to generate a secret password that could contain four possible combinations.

First a user must choose the length from 8 to 128 characters long.  After that the following choices must be made:

<li>  Do you want upper case characters?</li>
<li> Do you want lower case characters? </li>
<li> Do you want numbers?</li>
<li> Do you want special characters?</li>
NOTE: The user must choose at least one option or it will return to the start.</p>
